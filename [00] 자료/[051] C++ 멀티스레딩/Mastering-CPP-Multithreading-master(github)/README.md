# Mastering C++ Multithreading
This is the code repository for [Mastering C++ Multithreading](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-c-multithreading?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787121706), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Multithreaded applications execute multiple threads in a single processor environment, allowing developers achieve concurrency. This book will teach you the finer points of multithreading and concurrency concepts and how to apply them efficiently in C++.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
cout_mtx.lock();
cout << "Thread " << tid << " adding " << rval << ". New value: " << val
<< ".\n";
cout_mtx.unlock();
values_mtx.lock();
values.push_back(val);
values_mtx.unlock();
}
```

To follow the instructions in this book, you will need any OS (Windows, Linux, or macOS) and any C++ compiler installed on your systems.
