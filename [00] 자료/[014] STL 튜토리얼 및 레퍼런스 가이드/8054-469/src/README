Guide, Second Edition: C++ Programming with the Standard Template
Library (Boston, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2001).


CONTENTS

README:
  This file.

Makefiles:
  Two sample Makefiles are included which build all of the example
  programs.  The first uses Windows-style file extensions (.obj and
  .exe) and the second uses Unix-style extensions (.o and nothing).
  You may need to edit the Makefiles slightly to work with your
  compiler.  This Makefile should be compatible with most Unix make
  programs including GNU make.

Source Code (*.cpp, *.h):
  In this book all major and most minor points are illustrated with
  actual code examples, nearly 100 small programs in all.  The source
  code for all of these programs (and for variations mentioned in the
  book) is included here.

Dictionary file (diction):
  Several of the programs in Part II of the book use a file containing
  a dictionary of English words.  You can use the programs with your
  own dictionary file if you have one, or use this 20,159-word
  dictionary file with which the programs were tested.

Theoretical Computer Science Genealogy file (TCS-genealogy.txt):
  The programs in Chapter 18 of the book uses a file which lists
  information about the doctoral degrees of theoretical computer
  scientists from around the world.  You can use the program with your
  own genealogy file if you have one, or use this file with which the
  programs were tested.  The file is also available from
  http://sigact.acm.org/genealogy/textfile.html.
