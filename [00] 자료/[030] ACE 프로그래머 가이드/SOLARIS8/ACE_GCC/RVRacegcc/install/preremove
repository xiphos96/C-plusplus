# This script runs at the start of ACE package removal on Solaris.  It removes
# any links to library files that were created in the postinstall script.
#
# CLIENT_BASEDIR is the path of the base install directory on the target.
# CLASSES has all of the classes that were installed.
#
# If the actions of the script are changed, postinstall will also probably
# need a corresponding change.
