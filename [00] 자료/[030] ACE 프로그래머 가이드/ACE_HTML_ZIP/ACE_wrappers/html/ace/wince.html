<a name="ce_status"><h3>Status</h3></a>

<p>
Been a while since I updated this file. Where to begin. Well, as of the next beta kit of <a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> (5.1.11), it should be compiling for the PocketPC. And it  will have new eMbedded Visual C++ project files (*.vcw and *.vcp). Even  though it does not have all of <a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a>, the stuff it has should still make it useful.
<p>
I have shifted off of Windows CE though, so the updates aren't going to come in as I once planned. Although I did get the library to compile and link, I don't have any tests ready for it.
<p>
I'm planning on getting the <a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> tests re-ported to Windows CE again. I say re-ported because I'm planning on dealing with the lack of stdout a bit  differently than Nanbor did. Instead of making a GUI front end for each  test (which I believe is what the WindozeCE stuff is), I'm going to let them remain GUI-less and perhaps write an application to read the log files after running the tests.
<p>
<a name="ce_evc"><h3>eMbedded Visual C++ Projects</h3></a>

<p>
<a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> now uses the eMbedded Visual C++ project files (instead of the older Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ project files). EVC is free from MS, either it can be found in the MSDN subscriptions (not free) or a CD from MS -- which isn't completely free either, since you still have to pay for the  shipping and handling.
<p>
<a name="ce_subsets"><h3>Subsets</h3></a>

<p>
<a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> on CE is currently split into two libraries, ace_os.dll and ace.dll. The ace_os library contains the files which are considered part of the <a class="el" href="classACE__OS.html">ACE_OS</a> subset. The ace library contains everything else. If <a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> becomes more splittable, ace.dll will probably be broken apart even more.
<p>
And unlike the current *nix subsets, these two libraries are truly separate and do not require recompilation when the subsets required are changed.
<p>
<a name="ce_tao"><h3>TAO</h3></a>

<p>
While it would be nice to get TAO working on CE, I doubt I'll get a chance to work on it before graduating. OCI has said there has been some interest in  it, but I don't know how that is going right now.
<p>
<a name="ce_wchar"><h3>Unicode/WChar</h3></a>

<p>
<a class="el" href="classACE.html">ACE</a> on WindowsCE automatically has ACE_HAS_WCHAR and ACE_USES_WCHAR turned on. Thus ACE_TCHAR and <a class="el" href="ace__wchar_8h.html#a8">ACE_TEXT</a>() are the wide char versions.
