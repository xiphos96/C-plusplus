<p>
As with any program, there is always a wishlist of things to do.
<p>
<a name="ort"><h3>Use Object Reference Template (ORT) Features</h3></a>

<p>
Use ORT so that the ImR-ified IORs doesnt have any information about the ImR_Activators. Right now, even though, the ImplRepo_Service is the one that is exposed to the client, the IOR will have a reference to the ImR_Activator. By using ORT features, we want the IOR to refer to the ImplRepo_Service rather than the underlying ImR_Activator. That way the ImR_Activator is totally blocked from the client using the ImR service.
<p>
<a name="ort_design"><h3>Design Considerations</h3></a>

<p>
For the above mentioned purposes, we can say that the ImplRepo_Service acts as the gateway which receives requests on behalf of the actual ImR_Activator.
<p>
The ImplRepo_Service will now need a new IDL method 'create_object'. The create_object method will take the interface_repository_id of the object that has to be gatewayed (ImR_Activator's) and the <a class="elRef" doxygen="TAO.tag:../" href="../namespaceCORBA.html#a79">CORBA::Object_ptr</a> of the gatewayed object. And, using these two will create an object which will point to the ImplRepo_Service and will also know that the ultimate receiver is the ImR_Activator.
<p>
So, this is how it works.
<p>
As before, we will first run the ImplRepo_Service. And, then run an ImR_Activator. We will use interceptors and in the post_init method, we will add an ior interceptor which will have the ImplRepo_Service object. By this, the IOR that is generated will actually point to the ImplRepo_Service rather than ImR_Activator. So, the IOR which is visible to the client will show that the IOR actually points to the ImplRepo_Service.
<p>
When a client sends a request to the ImplRepoService, the request will come to ImplRepo_Service which will send the request to the actual ImR_Activator.
<p>
<a name="AMH"><h3>Use AMH Features</h3></a>

<p>
Use the AMH features to improve the <a class="elRef" doxygen="TAO.tag:../" href="../namespaceTAO.html">TAO</a> IMR performance.
<p>
<a name="logicalnames"><h3>Logical Server names</h3></a>

<p>
In the IDL interface, but not used on the server side or fully implemented in tao_ImR.
<p>
<a name="shutdown"><h3>Server Shutdown</h3></a>

<p>
Only cooperative shutdown implemented right now. Since we keep track of the Process ID, then we could kill the server if it doesn't cooperate.
<p>
<a name="optimization"><h3>Client-side Optimizations</h3></a>

<p>
Nothing yet.
<p>
<a name="security"><h3>Server Security</h3></a>

<p>
Nothing really here. There is two main things I have in mind.
<p>
First, the security service would be useful to restrict access to some of the Administration methods
<p>
Second, without a security service we should provide some sort of flag to the ImR that disables the Administration methods. That way, the database can be set up with the servers in a controlled run of the ImR. Then the ImR could be run again reading in the database without Admin access.
<p>
<a name="federations"><h3>Federations</h3></a>

<p>
Nothing yet.
<p>
<a name="dllserver"><h3>DLL servers</h3></a>

<p>
Nothing yet.
<p>
<a name="XML"><h3>Database Support</h3></a>

<p>
As of now, the support is only to be able to have the information about a registered server written to an XML file. Have to support retrieving information from the XML file to be able to do any actions on the registered servers.
<p>
<a name="Remove"><h3>ImR_Activator</h3></a>

<p>
We can now successfully register an ImR_Activator. But, we have to yet provide support to gracefully unregister the ImR_Activator from the ImplRepo_Service. The ImplRepo_Service then has to try to transfer the servers that were registered with this instance to other activators.
