Setup Program to Install Examples

A setup program for the book examples is located in:

    Setup\Setup.exe

This setup program copies the files to your hard disk and 
clears the read-only flag on the files. You must have
administrative privileges to run this setup program on 
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft
