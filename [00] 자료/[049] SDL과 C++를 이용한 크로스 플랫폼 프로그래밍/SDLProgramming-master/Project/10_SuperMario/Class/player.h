Description:
	Contains interface for the player class: the figure that the user of the program will control
	NOTE: strategy for implementation of this class comes from the following URL: http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson20/index.php
	Contains functions that allow the user to input using keys from the main program and manipulate the player image on the main window screen called from the main function
